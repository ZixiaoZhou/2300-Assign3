# 🎈 Bubble Clicker - MonoGame Edition

With **Bubble Clicker**, players participate in a bubble clicking contest, clicking as many bubbles as they can in **a minute** to gain the highest score. Bubble Clicker has one game mode with **two levels**:
- **Level 1**: Players are only able to click **bubbles**, which earns them the highest score.
- **Level 2**: Features the additional **bombs** which players can click, but these will cost the player points.

In the end, players are ranked **on the leaderboard** for their **score and number of clicks**, and their reflexes are put to the test.🚀
